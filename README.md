# CSC131-Lab2
[] Select one team member as the Git master of your group. The master needs to create a repository, and add your teammates and the instructor (uppala@csus.edu) as "Collaborators" in the "Settings" tab. (All members excluding the master will receive an email from Git, which informs you that you have been added to the master's repository.) 

[] All members clone the repository created by the master in your Eclipse.

[] All members create a java project named "Lab02" in your Eclipse, and link it to your local git repository. 

[] The master downloads Hello.java Download Hello.java, add it to your Lab02 project in Eclipse. Update line 8 with his/her information, then save, commit, push the change to Git.

[] Everyone else (excluding the master) pull the latest change from Git, which is the java file just added by the master.

[] Everyone else tries to update line 9 in Hello.java with their own information. Save and commit to their local repository.

[] Everyone else try to push the index (your updates in your local repository) to Git, resolve conflicts if needed. To resolve a conflict, you will need to keep the information added by your teammates, by adding your line 9 as a new line underneath the latest line added by your teammates to Hello.java. (Do NOT erase other teammates' lines when resolving a conflict.)

[] When everyone finishes, the master checks Git repository, and sees whether Hello.java includes all team member's information in it. If not, ask your teammate(s) to push their changes.

[comment added:  Also, please add your github public link in a document or comment box in your submission so that it is accessible for grading.
